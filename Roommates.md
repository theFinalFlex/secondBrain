I pay $650 in rent in Chicago, before I got here I was in a rough spot in my life, this was the cheapest I could find. Now that I am doing better for myself and looking to move out, I am interviewing new roommates. Being right next to section 8 housing this attracts a lot of people in a similar situation. Had 3 people come over to check the spot out
1. First guy makes 110k but has 400 credit score and is going through a breakup
2. Second dude is young and got violated by his best friend since 2015 and is tryna get out ASAP, really funny guy/artist
3. Third guy lives in a abusive Asian household and tryna get out which I related to
