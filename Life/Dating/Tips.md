- Max out body (fit, clothes, hair, tattoos, jewelry)
- Be confident
- Read books, workout, be successful in career
- Be non-Chalant or don't worry about the outcome of life
- Charisma, dating is a hobby under socializing, you need to socialize a lot



I feel like I fixed my self-esteem, I accepted who I am, I am not ashamed of myself, I take my journey as an opportunity to grow but still enjoy the present, I have multiple purposes in life, my goal is to become a cyberpunk, I want to be a father, I am ambitious and driven, my habits could be better but they have improved. I want to work on charisma now. 

Should I Date During My Grind  
No active pursuit of dating right now—stay in monk mode. Focus on building yourself up: certifications, fitness, mindset. Keep a low-effort dating profile if desired, but only engage with high-quality, supportive women who respect your mission. Your future wife is the reward for surviving this journey.

You're fine being the stay-at-home dad if she works—you’re flexible but still masculine and protective

Security (emotional, financial, physical)  
Purpose and direction  
Confidence without ego  
Emotional maturity  
Masculine leadership and decisiveness

“I Respond, I Don’t React” Examples  
Girl flakes – stay calm, say “no worries,” move on

Ask better questions (example: “What do you wish you learned earlier?”)  
Rephrase what people say to show you’re listening  
Drop value if you can (cert notes, insights, tools)  
Read the room and match energy  
Ask about the person, not just their job  
Follow up cleanly (short respectful DM)
