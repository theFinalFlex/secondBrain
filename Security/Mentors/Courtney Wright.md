You can share this information with your friend who is interested in Engineering - if you specify what type of Security Engineering (Cloud, SIEM, Automation, etc.) then I would know but so far this is for Detection Engineering/TH and you can also take this concept and apply it to other job titles since they revolve around similar concepts:
1. https://www.antisyphontraining.com/course/workshop-soc-detection-engineering-crash-course-with-hayden-covington/ (easy & moderate/lab simulation with VM provided)
2. https://tryhackme.com/module/detection-engineering (basic line understanding, I would also learn more about MITRE, Pyramid of Pain, Diamond Model - all three concepts are lab rooms in THM) 
3. https://academy.tcm-sec.com/p/detection-engineering-for-beginners (moderate lab course - gives you experience to set up your lab and run attacks while building detections) 
4. https://www.leveleffect.com/death-windows (more advanced resource - this resource was suggested by Day and another individual - I have not taken just yet)

Most all he would need to get comfortable with researching because most the time you are researching things before putting actions into place.

So Threat Intel and understanding attacks are important like how it effects the operating system, relationships, etc.
