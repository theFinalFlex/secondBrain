I’m working through a pentesting walkthrough (e.g., IppSec, TCM, HTB, etc.). Below are the raw notes I took while watching it. The notes are messy, partial, or might contain misunderstandings since I’m still learning. 

I want you to refine the notes based on how the actual attack played out (you can also check other walkthroughs for accuracy), explain anything I marked with a `?`, and give me a clean Obsidian-style Markdown output.

Please output **two markdown files**:
1. A detailed, cleaned-up walkthrough in plaintext markdown with headings and short explanations
2. A command-by-command cheat sheet, grouped by attack phase

Here are my raw notes:

Also include:
- AD-specific context where needed
- Corrections to anything technically wrong
- Clarifications for tools or concepts I didn’t understand
