   ### **Investigation Summary: Florence Nightingale Phishing Incident**

#### **üö® Incident Overview**

- Florence Nightingale received a **phishing email** impersonating **InvoiceHome.com**.
- The email contained a **malicious link** leading to **invoicehome.uk** (a spoofed domain).
- She downloaded **invoice.zip**, which contained a **malicious PDF**.
- The **PDF appeared blank**, but analysis showed **embedded malicious content**.

#### **üïµÔ∏è‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è Key Findings**

1. **Phishing Email & Malicious ZIP**
    
    - Email from **invoicehome.uk** delivered **invoice.zip**.
    - The ZIP contained **200-Ecorpgroup.pdf**, a blank PDF with possible obfuscated malware.
    - Florence complained about **not being able to open the file**, indicating execution attempts.
2. **Sensitive Files on Desktop**
    
    - Found **vpn password.txt** ‚Üí Indicates stored **VPN credentials**.
    - Found **remoteworking_ecorpgroup.ovpn** ‚Üí Could allow **trusted remote access** for attackers.
3. **VPN Connections Outside the UK**
    
    - Attackers may have used **stolen VPN credentials** for remote access.
    - **Splunk investigation needed** to identify the two **non-UK** login locations.
4. **Splunk Queries for Investigation**
    
    - **To find execution of invoice.zip**:
        
        spl
        
        CopyEdit
        
        `index=* sourcetype=XmlWinEventLog OR sourcetype=syslog "invoice.zip"`
        
    - **To check for VPN logins from outside the UK**:
        
        spl
        
        CopyEdit
        
        `index=* sourcetype=syslog OR sourcetype=XmlWinEventLog "vpn" "authentication success" NOT country="United Kingdom" | stats count by country`
        
    - **To track file execution & access**:
        
        spl
        
        CopyEdit
        
        `index=* sourcetype=XmlWinEventLog "200-Ecorpgroup.pdf"`
        
    - **To find potential exfiltration of sensitive files**:
        
        spl
        
        CopyEdit
        
        `index=* sourcetype=syslog OR sourcetype=exec "vpn password.txt"`
        

#### **üöÄ Next Steps**

‚úÖ **Confirm non-UK VPN logins** via Splunk.  
‚úÖ **Verify if VPN credentials were accessed or exfiltrated**.  
‚úÖ **Check for attacker persistence (new users, scheduled tasks, remote access tools)**.  
‚úÖ **Determine if Florence‚Äôs machine was used for lateral movement**.

vpn password.txt, remoteworking_ecorpgroup.ovpn
**Question 4 )**Initial Access - What are the two countries that have initiated VPN connections outside of the UK, as shown in the Splunk dashboard?Format: Country1, Country2
Spain, Maldova
**Question 5 )**Initial Access - Based on Florence‚Äôs mailbox, what legitimate domain is the phishing email attempting to impersonate?Format: domain.tld
 invoicehome.com
**Question 6 )**Execution - Looking in Splunk for traffic going to the public IP address (DestinationIP value) that hosts the phishing domain, what is the UtcTime timestamp of the first event that isn't related to Microsoft Edge or EM Client?Format: YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS
2022-01-15 16:36:07
**Question 7 )**Execution - Looking in Splunk for traffic going to the public IP address that hosts the phishing domain, what file is beaconing out to the IP, and what is the destination port?Format: filename.extension, destinationPort
template.pdf, 4444
**Question 8 )**Execution - Using Splunk or Autopsy, identify what file the initial malicious PDF creates when it has been executed. Submit the SHA256 hash to VirusTotal on your host machine and look at the Behavior tab. Identify the IP address and port used for the reverse connection (Think about the IP of the malicious domain!)Format: X.X.X.X:Port
